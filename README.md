# SuperCert - An Anti-fraud Identity Intelligence Blockchain Solution for educational certificates

##### ‘Certificates’ are a means of verifying the credentials of individuals across domains and geographies. A paper-based certification is fallible to manipulation and susceptible to fraud. According to a report by First Advantage, a background screening company, there are more than 7,500 organisations that provide fake employment and educational certificates. There are usually two problems at play:
##### degrees from fake universities and fake degrees from real universities.
##### For higher Education the other organization verifies it by approaching universities, and university approaches to colleges which can be a very time consuming. 
##### Proposed blockchain solution can be used as a mechanism to verify the degree obtained by the students.
##### Supercert resolve the issues, including, utilizing a multi-signature scheme to ameliorate the authentication of certificates; exerting a safe revocation mechanism to improve the reliability of certificates revocation; establishing a secure federated identification to confirm the identity of the issuing institution.
